Make Python CLI tools blazing fast ðŸš€


# Why?

Entirely avoid the relatively long time taken for Python interpreter startup +
imports.

This is significant, for example, when running code linting and formatting
tools on just a few files in SCM hooks, such as via
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).


# Installation

Install into the same Python env where you have tools like black or flake8
installed:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/taleinat/forklift.git
```


# Usage

Example:

```shell
forklift start black
time forklift run black --help
time black --check .
time forklift run black --check .
forklift stop black
```
